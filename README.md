# Bandcamper

[Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com) is a fantastic website for discovering new music, and supporting musicians. This is a library for downloading and parsing information from Bandcamp for use in your Swift projects.

For a detailed list of changes, please see the [changelog](./changelog.md).

I used [QuickType](https://app.quicktype.io) to convert a lot of the JSON to Swift structs. It's super handy and helpful.
